  |   TETRA's Escape is a platforming puzzle-game all about blocks.         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Blocks named Tetras and it is down to the players to do all that      |
  |   they can, to save them and make the most out of their special         |
  |   ability.                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Via the means of shape-shifting, Tetras can turn into different       |
  |   Tetrominos and used to fill holes and master puzzles, in an attempt   |
  |   to reach the portal on the other side of the level.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   But, don't just go expecting a linear adventure, as sometimes         |
  |   crafting a staircase to the heavens is the only way to make it to     |
  |   the end, so if you dare to dream big and go block mad, you might      |
  |   just have what it takes to bring all the Tetra's back home!           |
  |                                                                         |
